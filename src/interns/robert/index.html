            I am Robert Harkov. I have graduated in December but my big mistake is that during my degree
            I have not been in software development internship as it was hard to decide what particular thing I am interested at
            as in during university there are so many subjects and each of them are interesting in their own way.
            Then I had a friend who did boot camp in my class and that idea sparked me of doing it as well as it could help me find my career path or direction.
        </p>
        <p>I want to learn/practice software development with many technologies like React, Redux, JavaScript and etc. There are many interesting technologies
        and I want to do internship to understand what I like, what strength I possess for my future jobs as learning is one thing but working in a company
            is a completely different thing. I want to do internship to get experience and get my career going!
